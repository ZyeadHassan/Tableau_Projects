# Tableau_Projects


Iâ€™m happy to share my HR Analytics Dashboard project, developed in Tableau as part of my Data Analysis diploma. This dashboard provides insights into workforce trends, employee demographics, and departmental performance.

Key Features:

Employee Overview: Hiring trends, terminations, and department distribution.

Demographics: Gender ratios, education levels, and performance analysis.

Salary Insights: Income distribution by role, education, and location.
